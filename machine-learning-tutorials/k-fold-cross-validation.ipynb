First Split the dataset into k groups than take the group as a test data set the remaining groups as a training data set. In this tutorial, we create a simple classification keras model and train and evaluate using K-fold cross-validation."

    "\n",
    "On the one hand, you wanted a lot of runs because you wanted a real sense for a system performance across different settings. On the other hand, you end up changing the size of the training and test data when you do that, and that’s just a consequence of the good here. So it’s not like we can blame the method."
